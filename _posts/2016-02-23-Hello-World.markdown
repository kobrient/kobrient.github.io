This is a test blog post. More content to come. Check out the [About][/about/] page for more information about me.

Check out the [Minecraft Server][mc] if you're in to that kind of stuff. And this wouldn't be a proper "Hello World" post without an actual hello world:

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
	printf("Hello, World\n");
	return 0;
}
#=> prints 'Hello, World' to STDOUT
{% endhighlight %}
