###About Me
I am a computer hardware engineer living in Austin, TX. I have worked professionally at two companies that design x86 CPUs. Feel free to view an incomplete list of my personal [Projects](/projects/). You can find me through any of the social media channels listed at the bottom of the page!

Resume, publications, and references available by request.

###About the site
I mainly blog about technical subjects that interest me or topics I come accross at my job that I think are worth discussing. Every once in a while I may stray from the beaten path and do some writing on game design, tabletop, or general geekiness. We shall see. On a separate domain I host a fairly busy minecraft community. Reach out to me through twitter or email if you're interested in hearing more about that.
